# Hollow-Knight-Planner
To start, unzip and open hollow.html in the html folder. I've only tested this on chrome.
This is a interactive planner that lets you keep track of goals and requirements.
Right click a node to 'complete' it.
Hold ctrl to briefly toggle whether locked icons are visable.
Hold shift while right-clicking to claim a icon you don't have the requirements for (just in case I missed any possabilities).
1337 speedrunning tactics aren't considered for requirements.
Manually update your geo with the top left text box. If this is too much of a hassle, just give yourself plenty of geo so its requirements won't be an issue.
You can ctrl-click the title of an item to go to its wiki artical.
